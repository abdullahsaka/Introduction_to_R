I created this repository for data scientist candidates who want to implement basic algorithms in R Studio.

You can find the codes about attribute types, data exploration, dealing with missing data, kNN, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and ROC Curves, kMeans Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
